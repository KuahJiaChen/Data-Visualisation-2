            By 2022, there will 195 countries in the world, with a population of almost 8
            billion. Every country has a particular way of life, as well as a different
            economy, cost of living, and standard of living. Thus, it would be quite
            exciting to analyse the economic, geographic, national, and regional statistics
            as well as numerous indicators of the citizens' quality of life by developing
            an appealing visualisation. By taking a look at the visuals made in this
            dashboard, we can obtain an overview of the data for all countries.

                        The majority of the countries fertility rates declined consistently over time,
                        which is surprising. I believe that recent medical developments
